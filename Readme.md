# **Jaswalji-LLM-Web-Analyzer**

## **Project Overview**

**Jaswalji-LLM-Web-Analyzer**  is an innovative AI-powered tool that enables users to scrape and analyze content from websites. The system utilizes **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to process the scraped data and allows users to ask any questions regarding the content of a webpage.

The tool combines **web scraping** techniques with **natural language processing** (NLP) to provide meaningful insights, making it an essential solution for data extraction and real-time queries.

## **Key Features**

- **Website Scraping**: Automatically scrapes content from any provided website URL.
- **AI-Powered Query System**: Users can ask questions related to the scraped page, and the AI will intelligently answer based on the extracted data.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Interactive AI responses to various types of questions based on the website content.
- **No-code Setup**: Simple to use—just provide a URL, and the AI will analyze the page for you.

## **How It Works**

1. **Website Scraping**: The tool uses Python’s `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape the raw content of any website.
2. **Data Processing**: The scraped data is processed by a language model, allowing for deeper analysis and understanding.
3. **AI Response System**: Once the data is processed, users can ask questions, and the AI intelligently answers them based on the content of the website.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests to the target website.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For scraping and parsing the content of web pages.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For AI-powered question answering.
